00:09:25,925 --> 00:09:28,527
He's earned his position,
shall we say.

156
00:09:28,662 --> 00:09:30,362
<i>Well, that was the early days,</i>

157
00:09:30,496 --> 00:09:33,532
<i>and he cracked on with
his New World pioneer spirit.</i>

158
00:09:34,233 --> 00:09:37,836
What's he worth today?
100, 200, 500 million?

159
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:40,573
But now the plot
begins to thicken.

160
00:09:40,706 --> 00:09:43,275
He has reached
a crossroads in his life.

161
00:09:43,409 --> 00:09:45,711
The middle class and the middle
age, they've got to him.

162
00:09:45,844 --> 00:09:49,381
They've corrupted his appetite
for the horrors. He's gone soft.

163
00:09:49,515 --> 00:09:52,384
He wanted to cash in his chips
and get out of the game,

164
00:09:52,518 --> 00:09:55,087
and he seems to have found
the perfect customer.

165
00:09:55,221 --> 00:09:56,555
Smash cut, please...

166
00:09:57,056 --> 00:09:59,058
<i>to interior, a gala dinner.</i>

167
00:09:59,191 --> 00:10:02,127
Just a few words to say
thank you to Michael Pearson

168
00:10:02,261 --> 00:10:04,730
for his limitless generosity
and time.

169
00:10:04,863 --> 00:10:09,335
<i>Now, Mickey has been cultivating
a special relationship</i>

170
00:10:09,468 --> 00:10:13,739
<i>with the erudite, learned and
broad-minded Matthew Berger.</i>

171
00:10:13,872 --> 00:10:17,243
Yes, Raymond, I do know about
the Jewish billionaire cowboy,

172
00:10:17,376 --> 00:10:20,446
another slice of Americana
creating drama in <i>Angleterre.</i>

173
00:10:20,579 --> 00:10:24,583
And finally to Matthew Berger
blindsiding us with his donation

174
00:10:24,718 --> 00:10:27,886
to build the entire cognitive
behavioral therapy unit.

175
00:10:28,387 --> 00:10:30,724
[Fletcher] <i>So these two have met before.
Fuck knows where.</i>

176
00:10:30,856 --> 00:10:34,793
<i>Presumably at the annual international
drug dealers convention in Las Vegas.</i>

177
00:10:34,927 --> 00:10:36,996
<i>And they've done
some small deals together,</i>

178
00:10:37,129 --> 00:10:39,465
<i>but now they're ready
for the big one.</i>

179
00:10:39,598 --> 00:10:42,368
Well, that was unexpected,
Matthew.

180
00:10:43,068 --> 00:10:45,304
Now I understand why you're
seated at the head of the table.

181
00:10:45,437 --> 00:10:48,073
Snuck that one right by me, didn't
you, you naughty little girl?

182
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,476
Making a splash
with the gentry.

183
00:10:50,609 --> 00:10:53,178
Oh, I like to make a splash
whenever possible.

184
00:10:53,647 --> 00:10:57,449
Well, you also seem to understand
the significance of a proper attire.

185
00:10:57,583 --> 00:10:58,984
Indeed I do.

186
00:10:59,118 --> 00:11:00,419
I believe
a sense of ownership

187
00:11:00,552 --> 00:11:02,254
is vital
in every aspect of life,

188
00:11:02,388 --> 00:11:04,758
perhaps never more so than
when it comes to wardrobe.

189
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:08,594
For every look there is a season,
and for every season a strategy.

190
00:11:08,728 --> 00:11:11,130
[Fletcher]
<i>Now starts the alpha dance.</i>

191
00:11:11,263 --> 00:11:12,898
<i>They're not really talking
about clothes, Raymond.</i>

192
00:11:13,032 --> 00:11:14,634
<i>Oh, fucking no.</i>

193
00:11:14,768 --> 00:11:16,435
<i>They're like
a pair of old doggies</i>

194
00:11:16,568 --> 00:11:19,004
<i>sniffing round one another's
intellectual assholes.</i>

195
00:11:19,138 --> 00:11:21,807
<i>It's a good old-fashioned
cock-off, Raymond.</i>

196
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:24,644
Michael, I'm looking forward
to doing business together.

197
00:11:25,144 --> 00:11:27,613
- May we excuse ourselves?
- Yes, please.

198
00:11:28,547 --> 00:11:30,349
We should say good night
to our host.

199
00:11:35,254 --> 00:11:36,588
So what do you think?

200
00:11:37,156 --> 00:11:38,692
I'm not sure.

201
00:11:38,824 --> 00:11:39,825
[Matthew] Your Grace.

202
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:41,360
[woman] He's a fox,

203
00:11:41,493 --> 00:11:43,162
and foxes
have a predictable nature.

204
00:11:43,295 --> 00:11:45,064
Trust this Jew
about that Jew.

205
00:11:45,197 --> 00:11:46,666
If you let him
in the henhouse,

206
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,668
you can expect blood
and feathers everywhere.

207
00:11:49,803 --> 00:11:52,304
Fresh from
a farmyard pheasant shoot,

208
00:11:52,438 --> 00:11:55,174
these two are starting
to like each other.

209
00:11:55,307 --> 00:11:57,843
It's looking good, Ray.
It's looking fucking good.

210
00:11:57,976 --> 00:12:00,579
- [gunshot]
- I'm impressed with what you've done with your enterprise.

211
00:12:00,714 --> 00:12:02,848
You see, try as I might,
I can't work out how you do it,

212
00:12:02,981 --> 00:12:04,751
and bush is my game.

213
00:12:04,883 --> 00:12:07,386
How does anyone grow
50 tons of super skunk

214
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,421
without letting anyone else
know how they do it?

215
00:12:09,555 --> 00:12:11,957
I'm flattered to hear that
from you, Matthew.

216
00:12:12,091 --> 00:12:14,493
I imagine that big brain of yours
is sweating a stream of tears

217
00:12:14,627 --> 00:12:16,195
just trying
to figure it out.

218
00:12:16,328 --> 00:12:17,797
Brilliance
should be acknowledged.

219
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:18,997
Mm.

220
00:12:19,131 --> 00:12:20,866
Run the numbers
by me again.

221
00:12:20,999 --> 00:12:24,570
200 million gross p.a.,
100 million net.

222
00:12:24,704 --> 00:12:26,138
But your people
know this already.

223
00:12:26,271 --> 00:12:28,340
They've swept the numbers
for months now.

224
00:12:28,474 --> 00:12:32,378
The bottom line is I'll sell
it to you for 400 million.

225
00:12:38,984 --> 00:12:41,286
But you knew that already.
Hop in.

226
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:44,056
[Fletcher] <i>Now, I can't be specific
about the heroes and zeros,</i>

227
00:12:44,189 --> 00:12:46,626
but there was a lot of money
hanging in the balance.

228
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:50,262
Question: What would it be
worth to have the power

229
00:12:50,396 --> 00:12:52,965
to be able to pull the plug
on an operation like that?

230
00:12:53,098 --> 00:12:57,202
Answer: A greedy man would
want half the sale price,

231
00:12:57,336 --> 00:13:00,372
but a smart man would know
that 20 million pounds

232
00:13:00,506 --> 00:13:03,909
was just about uncomfortable enough
to make everyone feel comfortable.

233
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:07,647
You're a cunning and creative
toad, aren't you, Fletcher,

234
00:13:07,781 --> 00:13:09,615
coming up
with a plan like this?

235
00:13:09,749 --> 00:13:11,651
Yeah, but I didn't really
come up with it, did I?

236
00:13:11,785 --> 00:13:13,252
It was Big Dave.

237
00:13:13,385 --> 00:13:15,020
He commissioned me
to do a job on Mickey,

238
00:13:15,154 --> 00:13:16,689
you know, sniff about,
keep an eye on him,

239
00:13:16,823 --> 00:13:18,758
go through his bins,
reveal his sins.

240
00:13:19,391 --> 00:13:23,595
Mickey Pearson, the odious Yankee gangster.
We're gonna bury him.

241
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:27,533
Because it seems he's got himself
a new friend. Lord Pressfield.

242
00:13:27,667 --> 00:13:30,602
Question:
Is that the Lord Pressfield?

243
00:13:30,936 --> 00:13:32,304
<i>His Grace, the duke?</i>

244
00:13:32,438 --> 00:13:35,073
Yeah. Once fourth in line
to the throne.

245
00:13:35,207 --> 00:13:36,776
Apparently Mickey Pearson
has squeaked his way

246
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:39,211
into the crack
of his fat, posh ass.

247
00:13:40,379 --> 00:13:43,817
This is yours, Fletcher. I need a man
with your creativity, with your nose.

248
00:13:43,949 --> 00:13:45,652
Now, you know
you're my favorite bloodhound.

249
00:13:45,785 --> 00:13:47,586
I just think it's really
important to remember

250
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,154
who you're talking to, Dave.

251
00:13:49,288 --> 00:13:51,490
Of course I remember,
Fletcher.

252
00:13:51,623 --> 00:13:54,526
So just make absolutely sure the
check doesn't disappoint this time.

253
00:13:55,427 --> 00:13:57,329
The number is 150,000.

254
00:13:57,664 --> 00:14:00,365
He wants to ruin him,

255
00:14:00,499 --> 00:14:03,435
but I am here
to do you a favor.

256
00:14:04,671 --> 00:14:07,339
And it's not like you're not
getting something for your money.

257
00:14:07,473 --> 00:14:10,609
You could even turn that script
into a feature film, Raymond.

258
00:14:11,176 --> 00:14:14,379
We could make it together.
We could be partners.

259
00:14:15,113 --> 00:14:16,850
I have learned off you lot.

260
00:14:17,149 --> 00:14:20,586
You gotta look after number
one, and now it's my turn.

261
00:14:21,754 --> 00:14:25,491
The sun is not going up
for me, Ray. It's going down.

262
00:14:26,893 --> 00:14:29,929
So why has Big Dave
got it in for my boss?

263
00:14:30,062 --> 00:14:32,097
Two months ago,
your man Mickey

264
00:14:32,231 --> 00:14:34,834
<i>made my man Dave feel
like a right fucking idiot.</i>

265
00:14:34,968 --> 00:14:36,836
Henry. Mickey.

266
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:38,103
How did he do that?

267
00:14:38,237 --> 00:14:39,605
Didn't accept his hand.

268
00:14:39,739 --> 00:14:41,708
- Dave. <i>Daily Print.</i>
- Yes.

269
00:14:42,574 --> 00:14:44,644
No. Editor
of the <i>Daily Print.</i>

270
00:14:44,777 --> 00:14:47,546
[Fletcher] <i>Turns out Dave had
gone after one of Mickey's lords,</i>

271
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,581
<i>did a proper tabloid job
on him.</i>

272
00:14:49,716 --> 00:14:51,885
<i>It would appear that His
Lordship had had a quick spin</i>

273
00:14:52,017 --> 00:14:54,253
<i>on one of
his attractive young footmen.</i>

274
00:14:54,386 --> 00:14:56,990
<i>After the splash, shares
crashed, job went, wife followed,</i>

275
00:14:57,122 --> 00:14:59,191
<i>and even his kids
disowned him.</i>

276
00:14:59,324 --> 00:15:01,628
<i>Well, that Dave
can't half be a cunt.</i>

277
00:15:02,394 --> 00:15:04,162
But no one
will pull him on it.

278
00:15:04,296 --> 00:15:06,598
Too fucking scared that Dave
will do a feature on them.

279
00:15:06,733 --> 00:15:09,535
<i>But your Mickey, he's got
a fabulous set of balls.</i>

280
00:15:09,669 --> 00:15:12,839
So he snubbed him in front of a crowd
that Dave could only wish he belonged to.

281
00:15:12,972 --> 00:15:16,208
You know, lords and ladies, the sort that
Mickey feels very comfortable in front of.

282
00:15:16,809 --> 00:15:18,978
Men, excuse us.

283
00:15:19,144 --> 00:15:21,146
[Fletcher] <i>Well, he might just as
well have pulled Dave's cock off.</i>

284
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,016
I do believe that was a bit
of a fuck off, Dave. [laughs]

285
00:15:23,148 --> 00:15:25,117
[Fletcher] <i>'Cause he just
fizzled like a party balloon.</i>

286
00:15:25,985 --> 00:15:27,854
That's no reason
to go after a fella.

287
00:15:27,987 --> 00:15:30,657
Well, I don't know what to tell you.
He wants Mickey's blood.

288
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:34,259
And he would be getting it
too, if it wasn't for...

289
00:15:35,294 --> 00:15:38,731
You're a filthy fantasist,
and now it's time to leave.

290
00:15:38,865 --> 00:15:42,167
Oh, don't be silly.
I'm only just lubing you up.

291
00:15:42,301 --> 00:15:47,172
Now, there is a reason why Matthew,
or anyone else for that matter,

292
00:15:47,306 --> 00:15:50,275
cannot work out
how Mickey does what he does.

293
00:15:50,409 --> 00:15:54,212
How does he grow 50 tons of white
widow super cheese every year?

294
00:15:54,346 --> 00:15:56,248
Everyone knows
that needs a lot of space.

295
00:15:56,381 --> 00:15:59,786
So where is the space and how
come he's kept it under wraps?

296
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:03,088
<i>You can't just dig a hole in the ground
and drop 200 shipping containers in there.</i>

297
00:16:03,221 --> 00:16:04,791
<i>Oh, no, my love.
That will not work.</i>

298
00:16:04,924 --> 00:16:08,728
No. You have to be creative.
You need an angle.

299
00:16:08,861 --> 00:16:11,664
The problem with land in this
country is there's not much of it...

300
00:16:13,032 --> 00:16:15,969
and there's public access even
when it's supposed to be private.

301
00:16:16,535 --> 00:16:19,438
And the public have rights:

I should have known
it was you behind this.

Rodge is supposed to be

Don't blame the Dodge,

You know he's got
a special nose

this old dog a favor.

What you doing here anyway?

498

Thought I'd come by to have
a cup of tea with my wife.

Well, go on, then.
Put the kettle on.

Looks like

- Second thoughts?
- No second thoughts.

502
00:26:32,718 --> 00:26:34,386
I like middle age.

503
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:37,890
I like gentrification,
private schools, fine wines

504
00:26:38,023 --> 00:26:41,760
and a spoonful of caviar
to help my medicine go down.

505
00:26:42,595 --> 00:26:45,998
But most importantly, I'm looking
forward to spending more time with you.

506
00:26:46,131 --> 00:26:47,199
Course you are.

507
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,602
Look, I don't want you
knocking around here

508
00:26:49,735 --> 00:26:52,037

and lost with yourself.

Well, fuck me.

510
00:26:54,708 --> 00:26:56,242
Most wives would beg
their other halves

511
00:26:56,375 --> 00:26:58,177
to get out
of this game, but not you.

512
00:26:58,310 --> 00:26:59,778
That's because
I know you, darling.

513
00:27:00,879 --> 00:27:04,016
Look, you'll have to
do this elegantly, love.

514
00:27:04,684 --> 00:27:08,120
If word spreads that you're getting
out, that could read as weakness.

515
00:27:08,254 --> 00:27:10,422
And if you smell smoke,
it's 'cause there's a fire,

516
00:27:10,556 --> 00:27:12,726
and that could
get expensive.

517
00:27:12,858 --> 00:27:15,761
So you're gonna have to stamp that
out without any gentrification.

518
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:17,796
But not you, love.

519
00:27:19,633 --> 00:27:21,333
Don't you do anything messy.

520
00:27:22,134 --> 00:27:24,403
That's why you've
got people, remember?

[groans]
I fucking love you, babe.

522
00:27:26,706 --> 00:27:28,073
Course you do.

00:27:29,041 --> 00:27:30,175
Any chance?

524

No, you can wait.

I've got a red-hot Russki

world and what doesn't.

What I fail to recognize is
why Michael should be motivated

a check for 20 million.

I'm laying pipe.

Well, you'd better put
something through it soon.

So what is that?
Is that a barbecue as well?

537
00:28:08,113 --> 00:28:10,983
- Yes, it is, Fletcher.
- I love a barbie.

538

That is a useful bit of plant,
then, isn't it?

539

So that heats up your knees
and cooks at the same time?

how to get one of them.

you if you fuck off now.

Is there any chance
of a steak?

Yeah, all right. Got a bit of
Wagyu in the freezer as it happens.

Yeah.

How'd you get
your hands on that?

Ask no questions,
hear no lies.

Okay, so what's the price?

Tell you what, keep the parts.
Consider it a gesture of goodwill.

You know
how to get hold of me.

with 100 grand's worth of free car parts,

because everyone knows that the way
to a man's heart is through his wife.

You'd make a lovely wife,

I know how you lot love fables,
so let me share a little fable with you.

639
00:34:15,114 --> 00:34:17,315
There once was
a young and foolish dragon

640
00:34:17,449 --> 00:34:19,686
who came to ask
a wise and cunning lion

641
00:34:19,819 --> 00:34:22,121
about acquiring
his territory.

642
00:34:22,254 --> 00:34:25,190
Now, the lion, he wasn't interested,
so he told the little dragon to fuck off.

643
00:34:26,659 --> 00:34:29,062
But the dragon couldn't
understand what "fuck off" meant,

644
00:34:29,194 --> 00:34:32,031
so he persisted and
continued to ask the lion

645
00:34:32,165 --> 00:34:34,067
about acquiring
his territory.

646
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:37,003
So the lion took
the little dragon for a walk

647
00:34:37,136 --> 00:34:39,839
and put five bullets
in his little dragon head.

648

00:46:03,188 --> 00:46:06,191
I like it.
You know, I like it a lot.

910
00:46:06,892 --> 00:46:08,560
We wrapped her
in cotton wool.

911
00:46:08,695 --> 00:46:10,596
But she was
our little Lor-la.

912
00:46:12,131 --> 00:46:15,000
Charlie called her that because
she couldn't say Laura at first.

913
00:46:15,702 --> 00:46:17,403
We miss her terribly, Mickey.

914
00:46:18,504 --> 00:46:20,105
I've failed as a parent.

915
00:46:20,239 --> 00:46:22,307
You mustn't keep
beating yourself up, dear.

916
00:46:22,441 --> 00:46:25,310
Anne's right, Charles.
You mustn't blame yourselves.

917
00:46:25,444 --> 00:46:27,346
It sounds as though Laura
fell in with the wrong crowd

918
00:46:27,479 --> 00:46:29,948
at a time when she was
particularly vulnerable.

919
00:46:30,082 --> 00:46:31,684
What more
could we do?

920
00:46:32,918 --> 00:46:34,620
It's happened
to so many of our friends.

921
00:46:34,754 --> 00:46:36,221
It's a curse.

922
00:46:37,556 --> 00:46:40,092
- Do you mind if I look into it?
- So you'll help us?

923
00:46:41,728 --> 00:46:43,262
Let me see what I can do.

924
00:46:47,667 --> 00:46:49,636
You should get yourself
one of these, boss.

925
00:46:49,769 --> 00:46:51,403
Well, that's the plan.

926
00:46:51,537 --> 00:46:53,038
Everything all right?

927
00:46:53,539 --> 00:46:54,874
You remember
their daughter?

928
00:46:55,007 --> 00:46:56,942
Yeah, Laura.
Nice girl. Good voice.

929
00:46:57,075 --> 00:47:00,612
Teeny sort of spunk-funk fuck pop.
Shame about the habit.

930
00:47:00,747 --> 00:47:04,016
She's gone missing. They've asked
us to find her, bring her home.

931
00:47:04,550 --> 00:47:05,517
Mm-hmm.

932
00:47:06,251 --> 00:47:07,754
Is that a problem?

933
00:47:07,887 --> 00:47:09,488
Well, I had a feeling
you might ask me this, boss,

934
00:47:09,621 --> 00:47:11,190
so I did some due diligence.

935
00:47:11,323 --> 00:47:13,025
I know where she is
and I don't like it.

936
00:47:13,158 --> 00:47:15,461
- I'd rather we didn't get involved.
- Why not?

937
00:47:15,961 --> 00:47:17,963
[Raymond] <i>She's on
a South London council estate.</i>

938
00:47:18,096 --> 00:47:20,365
- [Mickey] <i>So?</i>
- It's out of our jurisdiction.

939
00:47:20,767 --> 00:47:22,802
There's too many moving parts,
parts that we can't control.

940
00:47:22,936 --> 00:47:24,771
What if she doesn't wanna come?
It's gonna get messy.

941
00:47:24,904 --> 00:47:27,606
Well, that may be true,
but you're still doing it.

942
00:47:28,641 --> 00:47:29,975
I accept that.

943
00:47:31,143 --> 00:47:32,511
But can't you
send Frazier instead?

944
00:47:32,645 --> 00:47:34,346
No, I can't
send Frazier instead.

945
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:35,815
You're my best man.
I want you.

946
00:47:35,949 --> 00:47:37,349
[sighs]

947
00:47:42,387 --> 00:47:43,989
It's just that
I don't like smackies.

948
00:47:44,122 --> 00:47:46,158
It's the filth and the grime
and the grub in the tub.

949
00:47:46,291 --> 00:47:49,194
I'm not asking your OCD to spend
the weekend with them, Ray.

950
00:47:50,797 --> 00:47:52,364
Think of it
as philanthropy.

951
00:47:53,833 --> 00:47:55,200
Come on,
you're driving.

952
00:47:56,568 --> 00:47:58,537
No good deed
goes unpunished.

953
00:47:58,671 --> 00:48:02,742
[chuckles] And this is where you
have your moment, isn't it, Raymondo?

954
00:48:02,876 --> 00:48:04,543
This is where
you step on stage

955
00:48:04,677 --> 00:48:07,012
and set the dominoes flying
every-fucking-where.

956
00:48:08,146 --> 00:48:09,414
Meaning what?

957
00:48:09,548 --> 00:48:13,085
Meaning no good deed
goes unpunished.

958
00:48:13,519 --> 00:48:14,888
Knock, knock-knock,
knock, knock.

959
00:48:24,062 --> 00:48:25,364
<i>Buenos dias.</i>

960
00:48:26,198 --> 00:48:27,266
[man] Wrong door.

961
00:48:27,399 --> 00:48:28,567
[Raymond] Ah, ah, ah.

962
00:48:29,736 --> 00:48:33,138
My name is Raymond Smith.

963
00:48:34,139 --> 00:48:36,174
Can I step inside
for a moment, please?

964
00:48:42,614 --> 00:48:44,149
How can I help you,
Officer?

965
00:48:45,217 --> 00:48:48,420
I'm not the police. No, I just
need a moment of your time.

966
00:48:48,554 --> 00:48:50,556
It's about Laura Pressfield.

967
00:48:51,958 --> 00:48:53,492
I don't know anyone
of that name.

968
00:48:54,293 --> 00:48:56,595
It would be much easier
for all parties concerned

969
00:48:56,729 --> 00:48:58,865
if I could just step inside
for a moment.

970
00:48:59,632 --> 00:49:00,867
No, fuck off.

971
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,835
[boy 1] Jeez.

972
00:49:03,402 --> 00:49:04,871
[boy 2]
That's a nice whip, bruv.

973
00:49:05,337 --> 00:49:07,539
Killer motor. It's a shame
about them rims, though.

974
00:49:07,674 --> 00:49:08,975
[boy 2]
Yeah, lend us the keys.

975
00:49:09,107 --> 00:49:10,944
Put some chrome twenty-twos
on that.

976
00:49:11,076 --> 00:49:13,445
Hey, my man's got the Dessies
and the bootcuts, you know.

977
00:49:13,579 --> 00:49:15,280
Deffo linking a jessie.

978
00:49:15,782 --> 00:49:16,950
[elevator bell dings]

979
00:49:18,183 --> 00:49:20,252
[muffled chattering]

980
00:49:30,063 --> 00:49:31,396
[man 1] What the fuck?

981
00:49:31,530 --> 00:49:33,498
[speakers: rock music playing]

982
00:49:33,633 --> 00:49:36,101
[chattering]

983
00:49:36,903 --> 00:49:39,438
- [man 1] What are you doing here?
- [man 2] Now, now, now.

984
00:49:40,172 --> 00:49:42,742
- [man 1] Get the fuck out.
- Now, now, now.

985
00:49:43,710 --> 00:49:45,912
[speakers:
music continues playing]

986
00:49:48,180 --> 00:49:50,248
As you was, boys and girls.

987
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:02,629
Sit down.

988
00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:08,801
Thank you.

989
00:50:13,505 --> 00:50:15,607
Shall we have
a little bit of fresh air?

990
00:50:16,776 --> 00:50:17,810
[music stops]

991
00:50:20,813 --> 00:50:22,949
Who the fuck
are your mates, Brown?

992
00:50:23,082 --> 00:50:26,786
No need to get excited, young man.
We will be gone in a few moments.

993
00:50:26,919 --> 00:50:29,488
No, no, no, you'll be gone before then.
Get the fuck out now.

994
00:50:32,659 --> 00:50:34,861
I can be dangerous if I want to be.
Get the fuck out now.

995
00:50:34,994 --> 00:50:38,765
Sit down, Power,
before you get yourself into more trouble.

996
00:50:38,898 --> 00:50:41,299
How d'you know my name? How
the fuck does he know my name?

997
00:50:41,433 --> 00:50:43,036
I know all your names.

998
00:50:43,736 --> 00:50:46,973
Apart from
that little anomaly.

999
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:49,809
I know where
you went to school.

1000
00:50:50,810 --> 00:50:52,779
I know who your parents are.

1001
00:50:52,912 --> 00:50:57,449
And I know you'll suck a
cock for a five-pound bag.

1002
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:02,955
Now sit.

1003
00:51:11,864 --> 00:51:14,867
Just so we're clear,
I work for a man,

1004
00:51:15,534 --> 00:51:17,170
a powerful man.

1005
00:51:17,536 --> 00:51:18,503
Michael Pearson.

1006
00:51:18,638 --> 00:51:20,205
Ten points to you, Laura.

1007
00:51:20,338 --> 00:51:21,674
Who's Michael Pearson?

1008
00:51:22,041 --> 00:51:25,210
Friend of her father's.
Runs London's puff game.

1009
00:51:25,343 --> 00:51:26,679
A big dick swinger.

1010
00:51:27,146 --> 00:51:28,513
What is your name,
young man?

1011
00:51:29,481 --> 00:51:31,718
- Aslan.
- And where are you from, Aslan?

1012
00:51:31,851 --> 00:51:33,786
You don't sound like
one of the natives.

1013
00:51:34,386 --> 00:51:35,587
Disneyland.

1014
00:51:35,722 --> 00:51:37,289
Sounds about right.

1015
00:51:37,824 --> 00:51:39,558
Well, you are correct.
He is a big dick swinger.

1016
00:51:39,692 --> 00:51:42,028
But I wouldn't want him
to hear you say that.

1017
00:51:42,161 --> 00:51:45,898
It's best you forget what he apparently
does for a living after we depart.

1018
00:51:46,733 --> 00:51:50,103
Now, Laura, your father's
asked us to bring you home.

1019
00:51:50,235 --> 00:51:51,536
She's not going anywhere.

1020
00:52:00,913 --> 00:52:02,181
Do you mind if I sit?

1021
00:52:02,314 --> 00:52:03,548
Yes.

1022
00:52:13,525 --> 00:52:18,765
[sighs] I don't build a joint like
the Americans and the new school...

1023
00:52:19,464 --> 00:52:23,236
back-strapping, jockstrapping,
coke-wrapping, and all that bollocks.

1024
00:52:23,770 --> 00:52:26,739
I like a good old-fashioned
50-50 mix, me.

1025
00:52:27,206 --> 00:52:28,674
That's how we used to play.

1026
00:52:29,274 --> 00:52:31,077
If there's one thing
I will never understand,

1027
00:52:31,210 --> 00:52:33,311
it's why you lot
get addicted to heroin.

1028
00:52:33,913 --> 00:52:37,750
If there's one drug you should not
chase, it is the dirty dragon.

1029
00:52:38,651 --> 00:52:40,186
Did you ever
give it a spin, Bunny?

1030
00:52:40,318 --> 00:52:43,156
No, not me, Ray.
I don't even puff anymore.

1031
00:52:43,288 --> 00:52:47,325
Of course not. Bunny likes the gym.
You can probably see that.

1032
00:52:48,227 --> 00:52:51,164
- What are you benching these days?
- Three wheels a side.

1033
00:52:52,064 --> 00:52:53,266
What about you, Brown?

1034
00:52:53,699 --> 00:52:56,903
What about me?
[stammers] What could I lift?

1035
00:52:57,569 --> 00:53:00,273
You couldn't lift
a wheel of cheese, you cunt.

1036
00:53:03,743 --> 00:53:04,977
Now...

1037
00:53:06,879 --> 00:53:08,781
if you wanna be naughty,

1038
00:53:08,915 --> 00:53:11,951
what happened to a little smoke
and a poke and a glass of wine,

1039
00:53:12,084 --> 00:53:14,319
some Barry White,
candles around the bath

1040
00:53:14,452 --> 00:53:15,988
and put your finger
in the missus?

1041
00:53:16,789 --> 00:53:18,224
Who's Barry White?

1042
00:53:18,858 --> 00:53:20,293
[Bunny] Big black geezer.

1043
00:53:20,425 --> 00:53:21,694
Sexy voice.

1044
00:53:21,828 --> 00:53:23,629
I'm... I'm lost.

1045
00:53:23,763 --> 00:53:27,465
Am I in the bath with Barry
White's finger in my missus?

1046
00:53:27,867 --> 00:53:31,971
Be quiet, Brown. You were lost
long before Barry White walked in.

1047
00:53:43,883 --> 00:53:45,818
If you lot are unhappy,

1048
00:53:45,952 --> 00:53:48,486
you should share your thoughts
with your friends.

1049
00:53:49,121 --> 00:53:52,357
Nice friends. Talk it out,
find a positive solution.

1050
00:53:52,959 --> 00:53:57,029
But, no,
all you lot choose squalor.

1051
00:53:57,997 --> 00:54:00,532
Drowning in
your liberal white guilt.

1052
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:03,302
Sorry,
what am I guilty of?

1053
00:54:03,435 --> 00:54:05,503
Being a cunt, Brown.

1054
00:54:06,839 --> 00:54:08,373
Being a cunt.

1055
00:54:09,842 --> 00:54:11,844
Anyway, I'm not your shrink.

1056
00:54:11,978 --> 00:54:14,180
I'm just trying to radiate
some positive vibes man to man.

1057
00:54:14,313 --> 00:54:16,849
I mean, that's what this puff
game used to be all about.

1058
00:54:20,319 --> 00:54:21,687
Anyway...

1059
00:54:23,856 --> 00:54:25,091
back to you, Laura,

1060
00:54:25,224 --> 00:54:28,393
queen in this here
kingdom of shit.

1061
00:54:28,995 --> 00:54:32,865
A single rose

[clock chimes]

1219
01:02:51,865 --> 01:02:53,031
Is there a problem here, Ray?

1220
01:02:53,165 --> 01:02:54,466
I don't know.

1221
01:02:55,601 --> 01:02:57,202
Is there a problem here,
Fletcher?

1222
01:02:58,103 --> 01:02:59,905
I see no problem at all.

1223
01:03:01,775 --> 01:03:03,542
I forgot to wash my hands.

1224
01:03:05,244 --> 01:03:06,713
Next time call first.

1225
01:03:06,846 --> 01:03:08,247
Sorry, guv.

1226
01:03:09,749 --> 01:03:11,583
And you haven't
heard a whisper?

1227
01:03:11,718 --> 01:03:13,585
How can so much bush go missing
and nobody know nothing?

1228
01:03:13,720 --> 01:03:16,088
[man over phone] <i>Ah,
I've heard nothing, Coach, honestly.</i>

1229
01:03:16,221 --> 01:03:18,056
<i>Nothing on the street.
But you know what?</i>

1230
01:03:18,190 --> 01:03:20,058
<i>There is this geezer
called Mickey Pearson.</i>

1231
01:03:20,192 --> 01:03:22,261
- Who the fuck is Mickey Pearson?
- <i>Ah, you know him.</i>

1232
01:03:22,394 --> 01:03:24,296
<i>He runs the bush game.
He's a horrible cunt.</i>

1233
01:03:24,430 --> 01:03:26,465
<i>You don't wanna
step on his toes.</i>

1234
01:03:26,598 --> 01:03:28,701
<i>But there's no way your lads
jimmied their way into his car,</i>

1235
01:03:28,835 --> 01:03:30,469
<i>so I wouldn't concern yourself
with that.</i>

1236
01:03:30,602 --> 01:03:32,271
All right, you know
where to find me, Chasa.

1237
01:03:32,404 --> 01:03:33,640
Keep your ear to the ground.

1238
01:03:33,773 --> 01:03:35,374
Primetime, in you get.

1239
01:03:35,507 --> 01:03:36,975
[Primetime exhaling]

1240
01:03:37,109 --> 01:03:38,310
Ernie.

1241
01:03:39,478 --> 01:03:40,946
Did you get
that Chinese fella's name?

1242
01:03:41,079 --> 01:03:42,181
- Phuc.
- What?

1243
01:03:42,314 --> 01:03:43,949
Phuc, like "fuck" with a "Ph."

1244
01:03:44,082 --> 01:03:46,418
Don't get street with me, Ernie.
Where does he live?

1245
01:03:46,552 --> 01:03:48,688
- Posh part of Croydon.
- Drop the rope.

1246
01:03:48,822 --> 01:03:50,456
There is no posh part
of Croydon.

1247
01:03:50,890 --> 01:03:54,661
- It's comparative, innit?
- Oi, Ernie, what are you doing?

1248
01:03:54,794 --> 01:03:56,295
Why aren't you training,
you black cunt?

1249
01:03:56,830 --> 01:03:58,096
I'm on my own here.

1250
01:04:00,265 --> 01:04:01,701
Did he just call me
a black cunt?

1251
01:04:02,134 --> 01:04:04,637
- Yes, he did.
- He can't do that. That's racist.

1252
01:04:04,771 --> 01:04:07,573
But, you are black and you are a
cunt, Ernie. Those are the facts.

1253
01:04:07,707 --> 01:04:09,575
I don't think Primetime cares
what race you run in.

1254
01:04:10,209 --> 01:04:12,679
The fact that I'm black has nothing
to do with the fact I'm a cunt.

1255
01:04:12,812 --> 01:04:15,013
He didn't say black people
were cunts, Ernie.

1256
01:04:15,147 --> 01:04:17,149
He was being specific to you.
One has nothing to do with the other.

1257
01:04:17,282 --> 01:04:18,852
And I'd go a step further,
if I'm not mistaken,

1258
01:04:18,984 --> 01:04:20,986
and say it was a term
of familiar affection.

1259
01:04:21,119 --> 01:04:23,790
Primetime's a Gypsy.
I wouldn't call him a pikey cunt.

1260
01:04:23,923 --> 01:04:25,925
Why not? He might be
very understanding.

1261
01:04:26,058 --> 01:04:27,493
Only if it comes from
a place of love, of course.

1262
01:04:27,627 --> 01:04:29,261
Now, back to
the issue at hand.

1263
01:04:29,394 --> 01:04:31,497
I need that Chinese
geezer's address, okay?

1264
01:04:31,631 --> 01:04:33,198
You'll have it
by the morning, Coach.

1265
01:04:33,332 --> 01:04:35,167
- Good lad.
- And, Coach...

1266
01:04:35,300 --> 01:04:36,870
- What?
- I've got some good news.

1267
01:04:37,002 --> 01:04:39,338
- What?
- I found out whose weed we took.

1268
01:04:41,206 --> 01:04:43,175
And now
you fucking tell me!

1269
01:04:44,109 --> 01:04:45,511
Did I say stop?

1270
01:04:47,012 --> 01:04:49,682
Ernie, this is not
the fucking time

1271
01:04:49,816 --> 01:04:51,918
to keep your cards
close to your chest.

1272
01:04:53,018 --> 01:04:55,087
Just tell me his name
isn't Mickey Pearson.

1273
01:04:55,220 --> 01:04:57,322
Blimey, Coach,
are you a Gypsy too?

1274
01:04:57,456 --> 01:04:59,091
You been reading tea leaves,
got a crystal ball?

1275
01:04:59,224 --> 01:05:01,360
That is not good news,
Ernie.

1276
01:05:01,493 --> 01:05:05,063
Mickey Pearson is terrible news in the
face of a violent and expensive debt.

1277
01:05:05,197 --> 01:05:07,232
[man speaking on TV, faint]

1278
01:05:14,106 --> 01:05:15,541
[Coach] I'm here
to see your boss.

1279
01:05:16,074 --> 01:05:17,744
[door opens]

1280
01:05:22,649 --> 01:05:24,082
Feel free to talk.

1281
01:05:24,717 --> 01:05:26,686
I gather you're the
consigliere of the outfit

1282
01:05:26,819 --> 01:05:29,488
that my boys were stupid
enough to fuck around with.

1283
01:05:30,723 --> 01:05:34,359
On that note, I'd like to extend
my apologies on their behalf.

1284
01:05:35,127 --> 01:05:36,729
My boys, they're naive,

1285
01:05:37,296 --> 01:05:39,331
they've had hard lives and they're
just starting to come good,

1286
01:05:39,464 --> 01:05:42,367
but they're my lads,
my responsibility,

1287
01:05:42,735 --> 01:05:44,904
so it's me that should be
accountable for their actions.

1288
01:05:45,437 --> 01:05:49,107
Now, I can return your goods,
but I can't return the inconvenience,

1289
01:05:49,241 --> 01:05:51,310
the time,
the fucking headache.

1290
01:05:52,210 --> 01:05:57,316
And so I offer you my loyalty,
my word, my time,

1291
01:05:57,750 --> 01:05:59,618
until that debt is settled.

1292
01:06:02,187 --> 01:06:06,291
I'll make amends,
but just leave me lads alone.

1293
01:06:08,360 --> 01:06:11,698
First of all, I'm gonna need to know
how your lads got the information

1294
01:06:11,831 --> 01:06:13,800
about where our farm
was sited,

1295
01:06:14,199 --> 01:06:15,969
'cause that's not
common knowledge.

1296
01:06:17,169 --> 01:06:21,373
Once we've overcome that little
challenge, then we can talk.

1297
01:06:23,508 --> 01:06:25,645
Well, I can do
better than that.

1298
01:06:25,778 --> 01:06:28,213
[man panting]

1299
01:06:33,151 --> 01:06:36,588
His name is Phuc, but it's spelled with
a "Ph," so it sounds like "fu-uck."

1300
01:06:38,691 --> 01:06:40,258
So it's Phu-uc?

1301
01:06:40,392 --> 01:06:42,461
What?
Yeah, something like that.

1302
01:06:42,594 --> 01:06:46,431
Anyway, he's the kid that gave us
the skunk farm job. Do you know him?

1303
01:06:46,565 --> 01:06:49,468
Yeah, we've met before,
haven't we, Phu-uc... Phuc?

1304
01:06:49,601 --> 01:06:50,670
That's the one.
Phu-uc?

1305
01:06:50,803 --> 01:06:52,805
- Phuc.
- Phuc.

1306
01:06:54,306 --> 01:06:55,440
All right.

1307
01:06:55,942 --> 01:06:57,644
Don't do anything stupid, now,
son, right?

1308
01:06:58,276 --> 01:07:00,479
[gasping]

1309
01:07:00,612 --> 01:07:02,214
How did you know
the location?

1310
01:07:02,347 --> 01:07:03,850
I need my inhaler.
[gasps]

1311
01:07:03,983 --> 01:07:05,384
Yeah, in a minute.

1312
01:07:06,019 --> 01:07:09,154
I need you to tell me how you
knew the location of our farm.

1313
01:07:10,355 --> 01:07:13,826
I've been trailing you for months.
Dry Eye was given the address.

01:07:14,794 --> 01:07:17,262
[panting] I can't breathe!
I need it, please.

1315
01:07:17,396 --> 01:07:20,298
All right, Phuc.
Calm the fu-uck down.

1316
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:22,167
[groans]

1317
01:07:22,835 --> 01:07:25,437
Right, here, steady yourself.
For fuck's sake.

1318
01:07:27,406 --> 01:07:28,808
Sort him out.

Here, here, look at me.

01:07:34,513 --> 01:07:35,782
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1323
01:07:35,915 --> 01:07:37,549
- Where's your inhaler?
- There.

1324
01:07:39,118 --> 01:07:41,319
- Right, here, take a blim.
- [inhales]

1325

Now, good boy. There you go, son.
You all right?

1326
01:07:48,027 --> 01:07:49,062
Fuck!

1327
01:07:50,163 --> 01:07:51,229
No, stop, don't!

[Phuc panting]

1330
01:07:59,038 --> 01:08:02,041
Fuck's sake, Ray. You need
to invest in some parachutes.

1331
01:08:02,474 --> 01:08:04,177
There's a pattern
emerging here.

1332
01:08:04,309 --> 01:08:05,678
I'm sorry, boss.

1333
01:08:05,812 --> 01:08:07,914
And who's this
jumping Phuc boy, anyway?

1334
01:08:08,047 --> 01:08:10,549
- It's Dry Eye's man.
- You mean Lord George's man.

1335
01:08:11,084 --> 01:08:14,619
It could just be Dry Eye's doing.
He's been getting bold lately.

1336
01:08:14,754 --> 01:08:18,091
Yeah. Well,
they still all work for Lord George.

1337
01:08:19,291 --> 01:08:20,993
I'm gonna take care
of this one myself.

Mr. Pearson.

1345
01:08:53,592 --> 01:08:55,094
And to what do I owe?

1346
01:09:03,970 --> 01:09:05,171
[sighs]

1347
01:09:06,939 --> 01:09:08,007
What you watching?

1348
01:09:09,307 --> 01:09:10,810
I'm watching the telly.

1349
01:09:11,376 --> 01:09:13,112
What you watching
on the telly?

1350
01:09:13,246 --> 01:09:15,748
I'm watching
the horse racing.

from Hong Kong.

1352

My only vice.

1353
01:09:22,354 --> 01:09:24,724
Well, that's not
strictly true, is it?

1354
01:09:25,224 --> 01:09:26,893
Meaning?

1355
01:09:27,026 --> 01:09:30,495
Meaning I've always taken vice
to be the definition

1356
01:09:30,630 --> 01:09:33,598
of any criminal activity
or wicked behavior

1357
01:09:33,733 --> 01:09:36,501
involving prostitution,
pornography or drugs,

1358
01:09:36,636 --> 01:09:38,905
so, no...

1359
01:09:39,972 --> 01:09:43,276
racing is definitely not
your only vice, your lordship.

1360
01:09:43,408 --> 01:09:46,344
I'd say you're eyebrows deep
in every vice known to man.

1361
01:09:46,478 --> 01:09:48,580
- There is a difference.
- Being?

1362
01:09:49,215 --> 01:09:55,554
I facilitate. I don't participate
in any of the aforementioned vices.

1363
01:09:58,124 --> 01:09:59,225
What about tea?

What about tea?

1366
01:10:11,503 --> 01:10:14,640
Well, that too is a vice.

1367
01:10:15,641 --> 01:10:17,509
Caffeine is a drug,
don't you know?

1368
01:10:17,643 --> 01:10:21,479
So is that what you're here
to talk to me about? Tea?

1369
01:10:21,613 --> 01:10:25,417
Sweet Mary Jane is my vice
of choice, as you well know.

1370
01:10:25,852 --> 01:10:29,121
Of course, I'm addicted to
selling it, not consuming it.

1371
01:10:29,487 --> 01:10:32,725
I specifically chose
to deal in marijuana.

1372
01:10:33,159 --> 01:10:35,061
Sure, I could see
there was more to be made

1373
01:10:35,194 --> 01:10:38,798
in shifting the white or the brown
powder, as you so chose,

1374
01:10:38,931 --> 01:10:43,468
but, you see, my jam,
it doesn't kill anyone,

1375
01:10:43,870 --> 01:10:45,570
and I like that.

1376
01:10:47,974 --> 01:10:49,642
<i>While your poison...</i>

1377
01:10:50,810 --> 01:10:55,447
is and always has been
a destroyer of worlds.

1378
01:11:03,656 --> 01:11:08,728
So, yes, your facilitation is
most definitely participation.

1379
01:11:18,905 --> 01:11:21,941
But I'm not here to give you a
sermon on situational ethics.

1380
01:11:22,540 --> 01:11:25,344
So why the fuck
are you here?

1381
01:11:25,477 --> 01:11:26,779
[stomach gurgling]

1382
01:11:29,315 --> 01:11:30,615
[gags]

1383
01:11:32,218 --> 01:11:33,252
[groans]

1384
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:44,596
You're starting a war
with me, George,

1385
01:11:44,730 --> 01:11:46,431
and I'm trying to moonwalk
with elegance here,

1386
01:11:46,564 --> 01:11:48,466
but I'm finding it
very fucking difficult.

1387
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:50,136
[Lord Pressfield] Laura!

1388
01:11:50,269 --> 01:11:51,938
[Lord George]
<i>I don't fuck around with puff.</i>

1389
01:11:52,071 --> 01:11:54,106
You send your man Dry Eye
around my place

1390
01:11:54,240 --> 01:11:56,075
to see if he can buy
my business for a few beans.

1391
01:11:56,208 --> 01:11:57,276
Laura!

1392
01:11:59,477 --> 01:12:01,347
[Mickey] <i>You didn't
think I'd find out?</i>

1393
01:12:01,479 --> 01:12:03,349
Having me followed
for months?

1394
01:12:04,616 --> 01:12:06,919
- [Lord George choking]
- Yeah. You crossed the line,

1395
01:12:07,053 --> 01:12:08,620
<i>and that comes
with a price.</i>

1396
01:12:09,221 --> 01:12:11,157
You raided
one of my locations.

1397
01:12:11,891 --> 01:12:13,659
You know the rules,
George.

1398
01:12:14,459 --> 01:12:15,962
What the fuck
were you thinking?

1399
01:12:16,095 --> 01:12:17,930
You raided one of
my locations.

1400
01:12:18,064 --> 01:12:19,932
<i>What the fuck
were you thinking?</i>

1401
01:12:20,299 --> 01:12:22,335
What the fuck
were you thinking, George?

1402
01:12:33,478 --> 01:12:34,512
[exhales]

1403
01:12:36,082 --> 01:12:38,451
[sobbing]

1404
01:12:47,626 --> 01:12:49,128
[breathing heavily]

1405
01:12:49,261 --> 01:12:50,663
[exhales]

1406
01:12:51,596 --> 01:12:54,300
[Lord George chokes, gasps]

1407
01:12:58,603 --> 01:13:01,707
Should you
try and undermine me,

1408
01:13:02,441 --> 01:13:05,177
or should you attempt
to threaten my position again,

1409
01:13:05,311 --> 01:13:07,913
I will be forced to accept
your call to arms.

1410
01:13:08,047 --> 01:13:09,248
Do you understand?

1411
01:13:09,382 --> 01:13:10,916
[breathing heavily]

1412
01:13:11,717 --> 01:13:12,818
Good.

1413
01:13:14,186 --> 01:13:17,857
Now, I can see you're feeling
somewhat under the weather.

1414
01:13:18,357 --> 01:13:20,059
<i>That's because
I spiked your tea</i>

1415
01:13:20,192 --> 01:13:22,995
<i>with a nasty little parasitic
genus called shigella.</i>

1416
01:13:23,829 --> 01:13:27,333
Left unattended, you will shit yourself
to death before the sun doth set.

1417
01:13:29,101 --> 01:13:31,070
I suggest taking
two of these fizzy biscuits.

1418
01:13:33,538 --> 01:13:35,241
You'll be fine
in an hour or two,

1419
01:13:35,841 --> 01:13:38,144
long enough to consider
your past indiscretions.

1420
01:13:44,050 --> 01:13:47,753
And, George, if I can get to
you in your own kitchen...

1421
01:13:49,388 --> 01:13:50,489
I can get to you anywhere.

1422
01:13:58,697 --> 01:14:01,367
- Did you do it?
- Do what?

1423
01:14:01,500 --> 01:14:03,969
Did you raid
Mickey Pearson's farm?

1424
01:14:04,103 --> 01:14:08,207
- No.
- So you're telling me that Phuc did this behind your back.

1425
01:14:09,075 --> 01:14:11,844
Well, let's just say this.
He didn't do it in front of it.

1426
01:14:12,610 --> 01:14:13,712
He did it
without my blessing.

1427
01:14:13,846 --> 01:14:15,414
But you did go behind my back

1428
01:14:15,548 --> 01:14:17,316
and offer to buy his business.

1429
01:14:19,351 --> 01:14:21,987
Yeah. Yeah, I did.

1430
01:14:24,423 --> 01:14:26,659
Now, let me warn you
the way you warn me.

1431
01:14:27,592 --> 01:14:31,464
There comes a point where
the young succeed the old.

1432
01:14:32,565 --> 01:14:33,732
Don't push me.

1433
01:14:38,237 --> 01:14:39,872
There are some things
I don't know about.

1434
01:14:40,005 --> 01:14:43,109
Something between Dry Eye
and Lord George.

1435
01:14:43,242 --> 01:14:48,547
Now, whatever it was,
someone killed Lord George.

1436
01:14:49,014 --> 01:14:53,452
Anyone else might think
that was you or Mickey.

1437
01:14:55,921 --> 01:14:58,057
Shall we continue
with our little story?

1438
01:14:59,725 --> 01:15:01,794
Does that arouse
your interest, Raymond?

1439
01:15:02,428 --> 01:15:03,929
[Raymond]
So Matthew knows Dry Eye.

1440
01:15:05,264 --> 01:15:07,299
- So what?
- Well, yes, I agree.

1441
01:15:07,433 --> 01:15:08,801
Perhaps they were
just meeting up

1442
01:15:08,934 --> 01:15:10,536
to talk about holidaying
in the Maldives

1443
01:15:10,669 --> 01:15:14,507
or the long-term implications
of leaving the EU.

1444
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:19,512
But I filmed it, had it lip-read,
translated and transcribed.

1445
01:15:19,645 --> 01:15:22,615
Rather like the classic
1974 film <i>The Conversation,</i>

1446
01:15:22,748 --> 01:15:25,117
starring Gene Hackman
and John Cazale.

1447
01:15:25,251 --> 01:15:28,554
You know, Coppola slipped that
one out between the <i>Godfathers.</i>

1448
01:15:29,121 --> 01:15:31,457
It wasn't really for me.
It's a bit boring, to be honest.

1449
01:15:31,590 --> 01:15:36,595
Now, can I just say, that Matthew,
he's quite something, isn't he?

1450
01:15:36,729 --> 01:15:38,697
He's not
your average American.

1451
01:15:38,831 --> 01:15:42,134
He's a Mr. International.
Even speaks a bit of Cantonese.

1452
01:15:42,268 --> 01:15:47,641
Come here. You play Dry Eye
and I shall be Matthew.

1453
01:15:49,241 --> 01:15:50,442
Come on.

1454
01:15:55,114 --> 01:15:57,883
All right. [sighs]

1455
01:15:59,118 --> 01:16:00,786
Try and get it in time
with his lips, all right?

1456
01:16:00,920 --> 01:16:02,521
- Yeah, yeah.
- Ready?

1457
01:16:03,622 --> 01:16:04,823
Roll camera. Action.

1458
01:16:04,957 --> 01:16:06,825
[crowd cheering]

1459
01:16:13,332 --> 01:16:15,501
[camera beeps, clicks]

1460
01:16:15,635 --> 01:16:18,037
[muffled chattering]

1461
01:16:18,170 --> 01:16:20,539
[Raymond] <i>There was an incident.
Lord George...</i>

1462
01:16:20,674 --> 01:16:21,774
[Fletcher]
<i>Fuck's sake, Raymond.</i>

1463
01:16:21,907 --> 01:16:23,442
It's a bit fucking wooden.

1464
01:16:23,576 --> 01:16:25,444
Put something into it,
you know, a bit of welly.

1465
01:16:25,978 --> 01:16:27,413
And action.

1466
01:16:27,546 --> 01:16:28,914
There was an incident.

1467
01:16:29,048 --> 01:16:30,716
Lord George
didn't come through it.

1468
01:16:30,849 --> 01:16:32,418
Didn't come through it?

1469
01:16:32,551 --> 01:16:34,920
The last thing you need to do
is attract any octopus.

1470
01:16:35,054 --> 01:16:36,355
Octopus?

1471
01:16:37,623 --> 01:16:40,392
What does that mean?
It's not a very good translation.

1472
01:16:40,526 --> 01:16:42,094
No, there's nothing wrong
with the translation.

1473
01:16:42,228 --> 01:16:43,896
Matthew's not that fluent.
And it's Cantonese.

1474
01:16:44,029 --> 01:16:45,564
Just go with it
and fill in the blanks.

1475
01:16:45,699 --> 01:16:47,032
And action.

1476
01:16:47,667 --> 01:16:49,735
[Raymond] <i>It's all on Michael.
He's to blame.</i>

1477
01:16:50,502 --> 01:16:51,904
[Fletcher]
<i>That is not a smart move.</i>

1478
01:16:52,037 --> 01:16:54,006
Don't tell me
what a smart move is.

1479
01:16:54,139 --> 01:16:55,274
[Fletcher]
<i>I beg for your pardon.</i>

1480
01:16:55,407 --> 01:16:57,109
You heard me
perfectly well.

1481
01:16:57,243 --> 01:16:59,778
<i>There will be repercussions
for Michael's actions.</i>

1482
01:16:59,912 --> 01:17:01,547
You think you're
running things, do you?

1483
01:17:02,047 --> 01:17:03,949
<i>Don't stroke my mouse hair.</i>

1484
01:17:05,217 --> 01:17:08,320
- What does "mouse hair" mean?
- Yeah, I think what he means is don't jeopardize my deal,

1485
01:17:08,454 --> 01:17:10,289
but I admit that one's
a bit of a googly.

1486
01:17:10,422 --> 01:17:12,091
Then Matthew loses it a bit

1487
01:17:12,224 --> 01:17:14,560
and his translation goes
completely out of the window.

1488
01:17:14,694 --> 01:17:17,496
Something about springtime
and sweaters.

1489
01:17:17,631 --> 01:17:19,131
I think what he means
is he's upset.

1490
01:17:19,265 --> 01:17:20,634
<i>And then Dry Eye
says something,</i>

1491
01:17:20,766 --> 01:17:22,268
<i>but some cunt
moved in front of me,</i>

1492
01:17:22,401 --> 01:17:23,737
<i>so I didn't get that
either.</i>

1493
01:17:23,869 --> 01:17:25,938
Your Cantonese
is dog shit,

1494
01:17:26,071 --> 01:17:27,139
so I'm gonna say this
in English

1495
01:17:27,273 --> 01:17:28,307
and I'm gonna say it once,

1496
01:17:28,440 --> 01:17:30,142
so listen to me,
Rubenstein.

1497
01:17:32,712 --> 01:17:34,446
This is how
it's gonna play out.

1498
01:17:35,814 --> 01:17:37,483
You're gonna
back the fuck off...

1499
01:17:38,450 --> 01:17:40,152
and I'm gonna
take it all.

1500
01:17:41,453 --> 01:17:44,189
And you will pay me
my respect.

1501
01:17:45,291 --> 01:17:47,526
[Fletcher] And there you have it.
That's all I've got.

1502
01:17:47,661 --> 01:17:50,496
Sorry. Show's over.

1503
01:17:50,630 --> 01:17:53,299
But I think
it's quite clear

1504
01:17:53,432 --> 01:17:55,868
that they're not just
mah-jongg partners, are they?

1505
01:17:56,435 --> 01:17:57,503
Mm?

1506
01:18:05,077 --> 01:18:07,513
Not all of that
was clear, Fletcher.

1507
01:18:07,647 --> 01:18:09,281
I mean,
according to you,

1508
01:18:09,415 --> 01:18:11,751
we already know Matthew
wants to buy Michael out.

1509
01:18:12,786 --> 01:18:16,255
- So why is that news?
- Oh, don't you worry, my darling.

1510
01:18:16,388 --> 01:18:18,190
We are gonna
come to the news.

1511
01:18:18,891 --> 01:18:21,593
<i>I'm approaching my climax.</i>

1512
01:18:22,561 --> 01:18:24,930
[chattering]

1513
01:18:28,300 --> 01:18:29,601
Dry Eye.

1514
01:18:30,135 --> 01:18:33,439
I trust you will make
Michael Pearson pay for this.

1515
01:18:34,306 --> 01:18:36,275
You are
the dragon head now.

1516
01:18:36,408 --> 01:18:38,177
Solidify your position.

1517
01:18:39,646 --> 01:18:40,979
It will be done, Uncle.

1518
01:18:42,081 --> 01:18:44,950
[Fletcher] <i>So Dry Eye got the upgrade

- Well, that's up to you, isn't it?

Either you do as I tell
you to and use the door,

or I'm gonna shoot fat Tony
right between the eyes.

You're gonna have to
trust me on that.

I'm gonna have
to check your grammar on that.

[Raymond] <i>So you're

on a figment

1613
01:24:11,209 --> 01:24:14,981
I'm basing my whole crescendo
on the sum of its parts.

1614
01:24:15,114 --> 01:24:17,349
A few minor details aside,
I wouldn't have any trouble at all

01:24:17,482 --> 01:24:21,453
selling this juicy peach
of a drama to Big Dave.

He'd cream
his fucking panties.

1617
01:24:23,622 --> 01:24:26,291
You're too smart to be
blackmailing us, Fletcher.

1618
01:24:26,425 --> 01:24:29,128
Yes, yes, and obviously I've
taken precautionary measures.

1619
01:24:29,428 --> 01:24:32,832
[chuckles] You can do all kinds of
horrible things to me if you want.

1620
01:24:33,331 --> 01:24:35,134
I might even enjoy them.

1621
01:24:35,267 --> 01:24:37,870
But you'd have to leave the
country and never come back.

1622
01:24:38,004 --> 01:24:39,972
So is that the story over
now, Fletcher?

1623
01:24:40,106 --> 01:24:43,810
All this, this whole buildup,
was leading to this next part.

1624
01:24:43,943 --> 01:24:47,180
This is the news that
you were asking about before.

1625
01:24:47,312 --> 01:24:48,748
Ready?

1626
01:24:49,347 --> 01:24:50,382
Matthew.

1627
01:24:51,216 --> 01:24:53,019
<i>He's gonna need some people
to run his business here</i>

<i>when he buys it
from Michael, right?</i>

1629
01:24:55,188 --> 01:24:57,990
He's gonna need a reliable pair of
hands, someone like you.

1630
01:24:58,124 --> 01:25:00,093
Hmm. So why didn't he
ask you, Raymond?

1631
01:25:00,225 --> 01:25:02,594
I don't know.
It's none of my business.

1632
01:25:02,729 --> 01:25:04,262
Because, I'll tell you,

1633
01:25:04,897 --> 01:25:07,399
he already had someone
earmarked for the role.

1634
01:25:08,201 --> 01:25:11,336
<i>Dry Eye.
He promised Dry Eye the job,</i>

1635
01:25:11,470 --> 01:25:15,240
but only if Dry Eye helped drive
down the price of Mickey's business.

1636
01:25:15,373 --> 01:25:19,746
You see, it was Matthew who told Dry
Eye the location of Mickey's farm,

1637
01:25:19,879 --> 01:25:22,247
<i>so he could steal
his white widow super cheese</i>

1638
01:25:22,380 --> 01:25:24,650
to cause ripples
and reduce the market value.

1639
01:25:24,784 --> 01:25:27,452
And that is why Phuc,
in turn,

1640
01:25:27,586 --> 01:25:31,824
<i>got those juice-swilling,
acne-backed muscle Marys to do the job.</i>

1641
01:25:31,958 --> 01:25:33,826
<i>It was Matthew</i>

01:25:33,960 --> 01:25:36,729
who set this whole
train of events off.

01:25:37,529 --> 01:25:39,799
<i>But what he did not
plan on, you see...</i>

1644
01:25:39,932 --> 01:25:41,634
Fuck you,
you old cunt!

1645
01:25:41,768 --> 01:25:43,069
I'll piss on your grave.

1648
01:25:51,944 --> 01:25:55,580
<i>Now, Dry Eye does not want to be
subservient to Matthew anymore.</i>

1649
01:25:55,715 --> 01:25:57,116
Doesn't wanna be
subservient to anyone.

1650
01:25:57,250 --> 01:25:59,018
This is how
it's gonna play out.

1651
01:25:59,152 --> 01:26:00,418
[crowd cheering,
applauding]

1652
01:26:00,552 --> 01:26:02,354
You're gonna
back the fuck off

1653
01:26:02,889 --> 01:26:04,857
and I'm gonna
take it all.

1654
01:26:04,991 --> 01:26:08,694
Dry Eye likes the smell of
power and does not like Matthew.

1655
01:26:08,828 --> 01:26:13,199
<i>So, the little dragon needed a gentle
reminder of who was really running things.</i>

1656
01:26:13,331 --> 01:26:15,367
You've been in this paddling
pool for two minutes.

1657
01:26:15,500 --> 01:26:18,336
I've been swimming in the ocean
with the sharks for 20 years.

1658
01:26:18,470 --> 01:26:21,040
I'll tell you
how this plays out.

1659
01:26:21,774 --> 01:26:23,276
You will drown...

1660
01:26:24,409 --> 01:26:27,146
and then my Mossad crabs
will eat you.

1661
01:26:27,280 --> 01:26:32,151
And this, my love, is why I want
my hard-earned 20 million pounds.

1662
01:26:32,285 --> 01:26:38,323
Because not only do I know exactly
how Mickey's business operates,

1663
01:26:38,456 --> 01:26:42,762
but I also know that the very
man he's trying to sell it to

1664
01:26:42,895 --> 01:26:45,530
is trying to force him
into selling it on the cheap

1665
01:26:45,665 --> 01:26:48,600
and has indirectly
started a war.

1666
01:26:49,302 --> 01:26:52,638
So, you see, I think you should be
calling me your trusted consigliere,

1667
01:26:53,605 --> 01:26:55,141
or your spy
behind the lines,

1668
01:26:55,274 --> 01:26:59,278
your intellectual
reconnaissance, if you prefer.

1669
01:27:00,780 --> 01:27:02,181
I'm impressed.

1670
01:27:03,415 --> 01:27:05,617
You certainly know
more than I do.

1671

01:35:02,061 --> 01:35:05,831
for, I'd say, at least 12 months
at a cost of 100 million net p.a.,

1823
01:35:05,964 --> 01:35:08,668
before marking down the loss of
staff, relocation and site rentals.

1824
01:35:08,802 --> 01:35:10,602
- You still with me?
- Yes, I'm following.

1825
01:35:10,737 --> 01:35:12,871
It will take
at least three years

1826
01:35:13,005 --> 01:35:16,475
to get your supply, distribution
and demand back to full capacity.

1827
01:35:16,608 --> 01:35:20,346
Your staffing costs are 25% of
your 100 million operational cost,

1828
01:35:20,479 --> 01:35:24,049
so that's 25 million per annum
for three annums.

1829
01:35:24,183 --> 01:35:26,518
And location rental
at 15 million a year,

1830
01:35:26,653 --> 01:35:30,690
that's a 120 GBP bite
right there.

1831
01:35:30,824 --> 01:35:33,392
Your unit economics
have taken a hit,

1832
01:35:33,525 --> 01:35:38,063
and forecasting out your top-line growth
margin in the current inimical climate,

1833
01:35:38,197 --> 01:35:41,467
I calculate what was worth
400 million a month ago

1834
01:35:41,600 --> 01:35:46,071
must now be valued
at an anemic, mm... 130.

1835
01:35:47,306 --> 01:35:51,043
You see, it's not about the
first domino that fell, Michael.

1836
01:35:51,877 --> 01:35:53,045
It's about the last.

1837
01:35:55,381 --> 01:35:56,448
Please.

1838
01:35:59,985 --> 01:36:02,722
I like you, Michael.
You're a good chap.

1839
01:36:03,522 --> 01:36:07,226
And if you want me to help you out of
this hole you've found yourself in,

1840
01:36:07,861 --> 01:36:10,896
I can pay you
100 million dollars today.

1841
01:36:11,897 --> 01:36:14,366
It's a good offer
and it's real,

1842
01:36:14,500 --> 01:36:16,636
and I'll do this
because I'm your friend.

1843
01:36:16,770 --> 01:36:19,873
My accountant can transfer
the fee within the hour.

1844
01:36:20,774 --> 01:36:22,809
I like your domino analogy.

1845
01:36:24,543 --> 01:36:28,580
The question I ask is,
who tumbled the first domino?

1846
01:36:29,214 --> 01:36:32,317
I'm afraid that's not my
concern or my business, Michael.

1847
01:36:32,451 --> 01:36:34,286
At the risk
of contradicting you,

1848
01:36:34,420 --> 01:36:38,390
it is very much your business,
and certainly your concern.

1849
01:36:39,859 --> 01:36:41,326
Only you made one mistake.

1850
01:36:42,695 --> 01:36:43,830
That being?

1851
01:36:44,430 --> 01:36:47,399
You seem to have mistaken me
for some kind of a cunt.

1852
01:36:49,234 --> 01:36:51,638
Let me introduce you
to the first domino.

1853
01:36:55,708 --> 01:37:00,379
It's a tad dramatic, isn't it,
corpses in freezers? Who is this man?

1854
01:37:00,512 --> 01:37:02,548
What's he got to do with
anything that I'm talking about?

1855
01:37:02,682 --> 01:37:05,284
I take it with that statement
you are in denial

1856
01:37:05,417 --> 01:37:07,986
of so-said relationship
with this frozen Chinaman?

1857
01:37:08,120 --> 01:37:10,289
Well, of course
I'm in denial of it.

1858
01:37:10,422 --> 01:37:14,092
I don't have relationships
with dead, frozen Chinamen.

1859
01:37:14,226 --> 01:37:17,797
Best not to be glib at this time
in the proceedings, Matthew.

1860
01:37:21,533 --> 01:37:23,770
Don't bother looking
for your Mossad crabs.

1861
01:37:23,903 --> 01:37:26,338
This is a fish market.
They have found a home.

1862
01:37:26,873 --> 01:37:29,408
To be clear,
I do not know that man.

1863
01:37:31,711 --> 01:37:33,512
<i>I'll tell you
how this plays out.</i>

1864
01:37:34,112 --> 01:37:38,685
<i>You will drown and then
my Mossad crabs will eat you.</i>

1865
01:37:38,818 --> 01:37:42,120
So while you were discussing
who would take over my business

1866
01:37:42,254 --> 01:37:43,756
after you fucked it,

1867
01:37:44,724 --> 01:37:47,794
you somehow mistook so-said
Chinaman for someone else?

1868
01:37:49,461 --> 01:37:53,499
Business is business, Michael.
It's nothing personal.

1869
01:37:53,633 --> 01:37:55,969
While I am not emotional
about the money,

1870
01:37:56,101 --> 01:37:59,873
there is a price indebted to me for
the blood I've gotten on my hands

1871
01:38:00,005 --> 01:38:03,408
restoring order to the
untidiness that you created,

1872
01:38:03,542 --> 01:38:05,177
and that price,
according to you...

1873
01:38:05,310 --> 01:38:09,348
400 minus 130...
is 270 million dollars.

1874
01:38:09,481 --> 01:38:12,551
And I'm keeping
the business,

1875
01:38:13,853 --> 01:38:16,990
while you are
getting in the freezer.

1876
01:38:17,657 --> 01:38:20,760
And you will make that transaction if
you want to get out of the freezer.

1877
01:38:20,894 --> 01:38:25,364
It is 25 below zero in there,
so I assume you'll last about an hour.

1878
01:38:25,497 --> 01:38:27,266
That said,
I wouldn't fuck about,

1879
01:38:27,399 --> 01:38:29,568
because frostbite is very
expensive on the fingers and toes,

1880
01:38:29,702 --> 01:38:33,539
so I would type as quickly as possible
while you have the use of them.

1881
01:38:34,239 --> 01:38:36,341
- Uh...
- After you've attended to that indiscretion,

1882
01:38:36,475 --> 01:38:40,345
you can then deal with the next
consequence of your shortsightedness.

1883
01:38:40,914 --> 01:38:44,884
As stated,
I am not emotional about the money.

1884
01:38:47,586 --> 01:38:51,256
But I am emotional about the fact that
someone laid their hands on my wife.

1885
01:38:52,157 --> 01:38:54,459
[panting]

1886
01:38:54,593 --> 01:38:55,862
My wife!

1887
01:38:58,463 --> 01:39:01,901
No amount of money on God's green earth
can pay for that transgression, Matthew.

1888
01:39:02,035 --> 01:39:03,602
No, for that...

1889
01:39:07,472 --> 01:39:08,708
I want a pound of flesh.

1890
01:39:09,876 --> 01:39:10,944
A pound of flesh?

1891
01:39:11,076 --> 01:39:12,611
It matters not to me

1892
01:39:12,745 --> 01:39:14,747
where on your anatomy
it is withdrawn from.

1893
01:39:15,682 --> 01:39:18,885
If you don't have the stomach
to take it for yourself,

1894
01:39:19,018 --> 01:39:21,119
big Bunny here
is very adept with a knife,

1895
01:39:21,253 --> 01:39:23,088
and, as you can see,
he's dressed for the weather.

1896
01:39:23,221 --> 01:39:27,526
But a penny short
or a gram shy...

1897
01:39:28,928 --> 01:39:31,363
and that freezer door
does not open.

1898
01:39:31,496 --> 01:39:32,531
Am I clear?

1899
01:39:33,666 --> 01:39:34,701
Good.

1900
01:39:35,768 --> 01:39:37,436
- Bunny.
- [Bunny] Incoming.

1901
01:39:47,714 --> 01:39:50,083
- [sizzles]
- [Fletcher chuckles]

1902
01:39:50,215 --> 01:39:52,618
What, is it Wagyu again
for breakfast, Raymond?

1903
01:39:54,954 --> 01:39:58,624
Aren't you gonna introduce me to your
mysterious and slightly menacing friend?

1904
01:40:03,997 --> 01:40:06,099
What's that for?
Is that for my money?

1905
01:40:06,598 --> 01:40:08,101
[chuckles]

1906
01:40:08,567 --> 01:40:09,702
Where's my money, Raymond?

1907
01:40:09,836 --> 01:40:11,303
There's your payment.

1908
01:40:15,108 --> 01:40:16,608
Go on, take a look.

1909
01:40:16,743 --> 01:40:18,610
Thank you,
mysterious stranger.

1910
01:40:28,755 --> 01:40:31,289
Well, that's disappointing, 'cause that
doesn't look like 20 million pounds.

1911
01:40:31,423 --> 01:40:34,459
It's more interesting than that,
your insurance policy,

1912
01:40:34,593 --> 01:40:37,997
all the photos, all the bodies,
all the skeletons, all the filth.

1913
01:40:38,131 --> 01:40:42,367
It's not the only one,
darling. I'm not a mong.

1914
01:40:42,501 --> 01:40:44,804
What do you think's in that,
you fucking eejit?

1915
01:40:45,672 --> 01:40:47,807
[Raymond] Of course we were
aware of what Matthew was up to.

1916
01:40:47,940 --> 01:40:49,676
We're not complete
fucking idiots.

1917
01:40:49,809 --> 01:40:51,744
[sizzles]

1918
01:40:51,878 --> 01:40:54,647
I've been onto you
for a long time, Fletcher.

1919
01:40:55,614 --> 01:40:57,684
- I knew you'd been following Michael.
- [camera shutter clicks]

1920
01:40:57,817 --> 01:40:59,451
<i>They're very similar,
our jobs.</i>

1921
01:41:00,019 --> 01:41:02,254
<i>Only I'm better at it
than you are.</i>

1922
01:41:03,956 --> 01:41:07,526
I knew when you came over that night that
you'd only be there for half an hour...

1923
01:41:08,393 --> 01:41:10,328
<i>Buenas tardes, Raymondo.</i>

1924
01:41:10,462 --> 01:41:13,532
...to tell me how clever you
are and try to blackmail us.

1925
01:41:14,266 --> 01:41:16,535
I've got some very important
information to impart to you, Raymond.

1926
01:41:16,669 --> 01:41:20,173
I also knew you couldn't
resist a £1500 single malt,

1927
01:41:20,305 --> 01:41:23,710
an £80 Wagyu steak and a
state-of-the-art smokeless barbie

1928
01:41:24,276 --> 01:41:26,913
- that even keeps your feet warm.
- I love a barbie.

1929
01:41:27,046 --> 01:41:29,916
I promise you, you will regret
this if you don't hear it.

1930
01:41:30,049 --> 01:41:32,685
And when the Scotch
got into your cold veins,

1931
01:41:32,819 --> 01:41:35,520
you lost the benefit
of your sharp instincts.

1932
01:41:35,988 --> 01:41:38,223
Oh, goody. Another bottle.
[chuckles]

1933
01:41:38,356 --> 01:41:40,893
Can you tell the mysterious
gentleman to relax?

1934
01:41:41,027 --> 01:41:44,063
Because I promise you, you will regret it
if you don't hear this. Sit down, my love.

1935
01:41:44,197 --> 01:41:47,599
See, I kept you there 'cause I needed
to know about Matthew and Dry Eye.

1936
01:41:48,801 --> 01:41:51,838
<i>Took us a while to find
your insurance policies.</i>

1937
01:41:53,505 --> 01:41:55,540
<i>'Cause you're
a naughty squirrel, Fletcher.</i>

1938
01:41:56,475 --> 01:41:58,610
Fletcher, shoes off inside.

1939
01:41:58,745 --> 01:42:00,046
Yes, Mommy.

1940
01:42:01,080 --> 01:42:04,416
<i>But it was made a lot easier after
I planted a tracker in your shoe.</i>

1941
01:42:08,888 --> 01:42:11,090
<i>You're never gonna be
a predator with us, Fletcher.</i>

1942
01:42:12,959 --> 01:42:14,794
You're always
gonna be prey.

1943
01:42:16,028 --> 01:42:19,397
So that's it. Three strikes.
We're good, right?

1944
01:42:22,101 --> 01:42:25,238
- I'll see you around.
- With the greatest respect, I hope not.

1945
01:42:31,576 --> 01:42:35,982
[sighs] Now, Fletcher,
what were you saying?

1946
01:42:36,716 --> 01:42:39,284
[Fletcher, muffled] It wasn't
Lord George that was after Mickey,

1947
01:42:39,417 --> 01:42:41,854
or Dry Eye, or Matthew.

1948
01:42:42,989 --> 01:42:44,322
Do you wanna know who it was?

1949
01:42:48,961 --> 01:42:50,163
I've got photos.

1950
01:42:52,899 --> 01:42:54,767
Right.
You've got 30 seconds.

1951
01:42:54,901 --> 01:42:55,935
Thank you, darling.

1952
01:42:57,970 --> 01:42:59,806
- [phone vibrating]
- Fuck.

1953
01:43:01,573 --> 01:43:03,009
Primetime,
what is it, son?

1954
01:43:03,142 --> 01:43:05,945
Coach, we're gonna take
care of this for you.

1955
01:43:06,078 --> 01:43:07,445
Ernie's got a plan.

1956
01:43:07,713 --> 01:43:09,414
What the fuck
are you talking about?

1957
01:43:09,548 --> 01:43:12,785
The Michael situation.
We're gonna sort it.

1958
01:43:12,919 --> 01:43:14,287
[cocks gun]

1959
01:43:14,553 --> 01:43:16,155
- Primetime, listen... Prime...
- [phone beeps]

1960
01:43:17,622 --> 01:43:18,590
Jesus.

1961
01:43:18,724 --> 01:43:20,325
[gate clinks]

1962
01:43:29,735 --> 01:43:31,503
[Fletcher] <i>Now, you
remember Aslan, don't you?</i>

1963
01:43:32,138 --> 01:43:34,640
The young gentleman
you kept in the freezer?

1964
01:43:37,109 --> 01:43:41,647
Well, this is Aslan Senior,
Russian oligarch.

1965
01:43:43,149 --> 01:43:45,350
<i>Ex-KGB. Made all
his money in gas pipes.</i>

1966
01:43:45,483 --> 01:43:48,688
And he's extremely sad that his
one-and-only son fell out of a window.

1967
01:43:49,155 --> 01:43:50,656
