### What is this
you ever have a quote from a movie or show pop up in your head but you can't remember on which movie or episode it was said and when?

BORED[still working on the name] is here to fix that, all you have to do is to input the line you remember - doesn't have to be an exact match- and the path where you keep you media.  BORED will transverse this path - and all of it subs- looking for `.srt` files then search these files and bring you the actual lines closest to what you remember along side with how close they are , what movie/episode and their time stamp.
